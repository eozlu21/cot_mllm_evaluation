Your response must follow the format of a Chain of Thought (CoT) consisting of:

1. **Inner Thinking**: Break down your reasoning into clear, titled steps that progressively build the argument.
2. **Final Conclusion**: Provide a well-supported conclusion based on the 'Inner Thinking'.
3. **Verification**: Critically assess the conclusion. If it’s flawed, restart the reasoning using backtracking.

</response requirements>

You are continuing from a previous reasoning attempt whose **Final Conclusion was incorrect**. Your task is to backtrack — revisit and revise earlier assumptions — and develop a new, corrected reasoning path.
